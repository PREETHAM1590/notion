"""
Database connection test script.

This module provides a simple function to test connectivity to a PostgreSQL
database using credentials defined in a `.env` file. It uses the
``pythonâ€‘dotenv`` package to load environment variables and the
``psycopg2`` library to create a connection. Running this script from the
command line will attempt to connect to the database, execute a simple
``SELECT NOW()`` query, print the current time returned by the server and
close the connection.

Environment variables required in the `.env` file include:

```
user=<username>
password=<password>
host=<hostname or IP address>
port=<database port, e.g. 5432>
dbname=<database name>
```

For example:

```
user=myuser
password=mysecretpassword
host=localhost
port=5432
dbname=mydatabase
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file at the root of the project (or in the
directory from which you run the script) with the appropriate values.

Note: This script is intended for development and testing. In production,
handle exceptions and sensitive data carefully.
