    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This is your personal Notionâ€‘style workspace. Use the sidebar to create pages,
       nest them hierarchically, manage simple tables, or chat with an AI.
    </p>
    <p>Pages are persisted locally in a JSON file, so your work will be saved across sessions.
       Feel free to explore and customize.
    </p>
    <p>If you delete the JSON file (<code>pages.json</code>) in the app directory, a fresh workspace
       will be generated on next startup.</p>
